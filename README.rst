ceph-ansible
============

Ansible Playbooks for Ceph: a collection of playbooks to get started with
a Ceph cluster and provision them easily.

Make sure you refer to the `getting started guide
<http://ceph.com/docs/master/start/quick-start-preflight/>_` before
provisioning a cluster.

``vagrant`` ready
-----------------
All playbooks come with a ``vagrant`` file for local development, so getting
started is even easier. Make sure you have Vagrant versions >= 1.2.0
